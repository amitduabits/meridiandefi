# Chain Grant Addendums — Summary

This directory contains ecosystem-specific addendums for Meridian grant applications. Each file provides chain-customized positioning, pre-written application answers, recommended funding, and a unique demo addition tailored to the target chain's architecture and grant program.

**How to use:** Select the addendum for your target chain, customize the bracketed fields (team details, specific dates, updated metrics), and paste the relevant sections into the grant application form. Each addendum is designed to be modular -- use sections A-F independently or as a complete package.

## Aggregate Pipeline

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total chains targeted** | 10 |
| **Total recommended ask** | $705K--$1,350K |
| **HIGH priority applications** | 2 (NEAR, Starknet) |
| **MEDIUM priority applications** | 8 |
| **Expected approval rate** | 30--50% (3--5 approvals) |
| **Mathematical EV** | $200K--$450K |

## Priority Rationale

### HIGH Priority

- **NEAR:** $20M fund dedicated specifically to AI agents. Maximum strategic alignment -- NEAR's entire ecosystem thesis maps to Meridian's architecture. Account model uniquely suited for agent identity. Apply immediately.
- **Starknet:** Up to $1M per grant. Cairo compilation path is a genuine technical differentiator -- provably correct agent execution is a category-defining capability. Largest individual grant potential in the pipeline.

### MEDIUM Priority

All other chains offer strong ecosystem fit and meaningful funding, but lack the deep strategic alignment (NEAR) or outsized funding potential (Starknet) of the high-priority targets. Apply in parallel with high-priority applications.
