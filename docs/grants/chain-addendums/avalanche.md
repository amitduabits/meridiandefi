**Priority:** MEDIUM

## A) Ecosystem Customization

Avalanche's Retro9000 program represents one of the largest ecosystem funds in crypto, and the foundation has made AI infrastructure an explicit priority. Meridian's architecture maps directly to Avalanche's multi-chain thesis: autonomous agents that operate across the C-Chain for DeFi execution, understand subnet-specific parameters for isolated deployment environments, and generate sustained AVAX burn through consistent gas consumption. Our 100+ autonomous trades on Arbitrum Sepolia demonstrate that Meridian agents are not theoretical -- they are persistent, gas-consuming participants in whatever chain they inhabit. On Avalanche, every Sense-Think-Act-Reflect cycle burns AVAX, making each deployed agent a direct contributor to the network's deflationary economics.

Avalanche's subnet architecture introduces a dimension that no other chain offers for agent deployment: isolated execution environments with custom gas tokens, validator sets, and throughput parameters. Meridian's modular connector system can be extended to support subnet-aware deployment, where agents operate on dedicated subnets with guaranteed block space while settling high-value transactions on the C-Chain. This subnet-aware agent architecture positions Avalanche as the only chain where institutional-grade autonomous strategies can run in isolated environments without competing for block space with retail activity -- a critical requirement for institutional DeFi adoption.

## B) Why Build on Avalanche Specifically

- **Direct AVAX burn from agent activity.** Every Meridian agent deployed on Avalanche generates persistent gas consumption through its tick-based decision cycle, contributing directly to AVAX's deflationary mechanism. More agents deployed means more AVAX burned.
- **Subnet-aware deployment.** Avalanche's subnet architecture enables dedicated agent execution environments with custom throughput and isolation guarantees -- a unique capability for institutional-grade autonomous strategies.
- **Ecosystem scale and DeFi depth.** Avalanche hosts Trader Joe, Benqi, GMX, and Platypus -- mature DeFi protocols with deep liquidity pools that provide rich execution environments for Meridian agents.

## C) Recommended Funding and Program

**Amount:** $50K--$100K from Retro9000 or Avalanche Foundation Ecosystem Grants
**Tier:** Standard (Tier 2) -- SDK with Avalanche as featured chain, multi-agent orchestration, connectors for Trader Joe + Benqi + GMX, backtesting with Avalanche data, and subnet deployment proof-of-concept.
**Milestone structure:** 3-month delivery with monthly disbursement (30/40/30 split).

## E) Unique Demo Addition

**Subnet-Aware Agent Deployment Demo.** Deploy a Meridian multi-agent portfolio system where a portfolio manager agent operates on a dedicated Avalanche subnet with guaranteed throughput, while execution agents settle trades on the C-Chain through Trader Joe and Benqi. Publish a comparison showing gas consumption, burn contribution, and execution latency between subnet-isolated and C-Chain-only deployment modes.

## F) Pre-Written Application Answers

**Q1: Describe your project.**
Meridian is an open-source AI agent framework built exclusively for DeFi. Agents maintain persistent portfolio context, reason about market conditions using LLM-powered analysis, and execute strategies through typed protocol connectors. The framework includes 8 core modules, 4 smart contracts, 19,000 lines of production TypeScript, 208 passing tests, and 100+ autonomous trades on testnet. MIT licensed.

**Q2: How does this benefit the Avalanche ecosystem?**
Every Meridian agent deployed on Avalanche is a persistent gas consumer, contributing to AVAX burn through its continuous decision cycle. The open-source SDK featuring Avalanche as the default chain drives developer adoption to the ecosystem. Connectors for Trader Joe, Benqi, and GMX generate sustained protocol activity -- swap fees, lending interest, and perpetuals volume -- 24/7.

**Q3: What makes Meridian different from existing solutions?**
Meridian is DeFi-first, not DeFi-adjacent. ElizaOS targets social agents, GOAT offers stateless blockchain actions, Virtuals operates as a token launchpad. Meridian is the only framework with persistent portfolio state, protocol-semantic connectors, pre-execution risk simulation, and multi-agent coordination. Every transaction passes seven pre-flight checks before execution.

**Q4: What is your subnet strategy?**
We will build a subnet-aware deployment mode where agent orchestration runs on a dedicated subnet with custom throughput parameters, while high-value settlement transactions execute on the C-Chain. This enables institutional-grade isolated execution without competing for C-Chain block space.

**Q5: What are your milestones?**
Month 1: Avalanche C-Chain connectors (Trader Joe, Benqi), rebalancing agent live on Fuji testnet, SDK v0.1 with Avalanche examples. Month 2: Multi-agent demo, Strategy DSL, backtesting with Avalanche historical data, subnet deployment POC. Month 3: SDK v1.0 featuring Avalanche, full documentation, agent templates, impact report with AVAX burn metrics.

**Q6: How much funding are you requesting and how will it be used?**
$50K-$100K. Breakdown: 40% engineering (connectors, subnet integration, agent types), 25% SDK and documentation, 20% testing and security, 15% developer relations and community.

**Q7: Is the project open source?**
Yes. MIT license. GitHub: https://github.com/amitduabits/meridiandefi
