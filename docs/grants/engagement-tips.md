# Meridian -- Community Engagement Tips

Practical guide for Discord/Telegram outreach. The goal is to be a genuine, helpful community member who also happens to be building something worth funding.

## Profile Setup

Before posting in any server, set up your profile properly. People check profiles before engaging.

### Discord Profile
- **Display name:** Your real first name or a consistent handle (not "MeridianBot" or "Agent_Builder_42")
- **About Me:** Keep it short and real. Example: "Building open-source DeFi infra. TypeScript/Solidity. Previously at [X]." Do not mention the grant application.
- **Avatar:** Real photo or a consistent avatar you use everywhere. Not a project logo.
- **Status:** Optional. Something like "building in public" is fine. Do not set it to your project name.
- **Connected accounts:** Link your GitHub (https://github.com/amitduabits) -- people will check it.

### Telegram Profile
- **Username:** Consistent with your Discord handle
- **Bio:** Same as Discord About Me
- **Profile photo:** Same as Discord avatar

### GitHub Profile (do this first)
- Make sure the meridiandefi repo has a good README visible on the landing page
- Pin the repo to your GitHub profile
- Have recent commit activity visible (green squares matter to grant reviewers)

## The DOs

### DO: Read Before You Write
- Spend 10-15 minutes reading recent messages in a channel before posting
- Understand the tone -- some channels are casual, some are more formal
- Check if your question has already been asked recently
- Look at what topics are getting engagement vs. being ignored

### DO: Be Genuinely Helpful
- Answer other people's questions when you can, even if they're not about your project
- Share useful resources, tools, or patterns you've discovered
- React to and engage with other people's project announcements
- If someone posts something cool, tell them -- devs remember who noticed their work

### DO: Ask Real Questions
- Every technical question in the messages file is based on real architectural decisions. If you ask a question, be prepared to engage deeply with the answer.
- Follow up on responses. "Thanks, that's helpful!" is the minimum -- a real follow-up question or "I tried that and here's what happened" is much better.
- Share what you've already tried before asking. This signals you're not being lazy.

### DO: Show Your Work
- Share code snippets when relevant to a conversation
- Post screenshots of your dashboard or agent output
- Link to specific files in your GitHub repo, not just the repo root
- Mention concrete numbers (100+ trades, 208 passing tests, 12 test files) -- specificity builds credibility

### DO: Engage With Ecosystem News
- When a chain announces a new feature or upgrade, comment with a genuine take
- If a protocol launches on the chain you're targeting, congratulate them and think about integration
- Share relevant articles or research you've read (not your own content every time)

### DO: Build in Public
- Post occasional updates about what you shipped that week
- Share challenges you're facing -- people connect with honesty about hard problems
- Celebrate small wins (first mainnet transaction, first external contributor, etc.)

### DO: Follow Up on Everything
- If someone answers your question, thank them and report back on what happened
- If a grant manager says "apply next month," set a calendar reminder and follow up exactly then
- If you promised to share something, actually share it

## The DON'Ts

### DON'T: Spam or Cross-Post
- Never post the same message in multiple channels of the same server
- Never post the same message word-for-word across different chains' servers
- Each message should feel like it was written specifically for that community
- Do not post in a channel and then immediately post in another channel -- space things out

### DON'T: Only Talk About Yourself
- If 100% of your messages in a server are about your own project, you're doing it wrong
- Aim for a ratio: for every message about Meridian, have 2-3 messages helping others or engaging with the community
- Do not reply to someone's question just to pivot the conversation to your project

### DON'T: Be Pushy About Grants
- Never lead with "I'm looking for funding"
- Never send unsolicited DMs to grant managers on your first day in a server
- Never follow up on a grant inquiry more than once per week
- If someone says no or "not right now," accept it gracefully and stay engaged in the community

### DON'T: Oversell or Exaggerate
- Do not call Meridian "the first" or "the only" anything unless it's verifiably true
- Do not claim mainnet readiness if you're only on testnet
- Do not inflate numbers -- "100+ trades on testnet" is honest and that's enough
- Do not claim partnerships or integrations that don't exist yet

### DON'T: Copy-Paste Responses
- If someone asks you about your project, write a fresh response tailored to what they asked
- Do not paste your elevator pitch in response to a casual question
- Read the room -- a technical channel gets a technical answer, a general channel gets a simpler explanation

### DON'T: Argue or Get Defensive
- If someone criticizes your approach, ask them what they'd suggest instead
- If someone says "we already have AI agents" (see below), don't get defensive
- Never argue with grant reviewers or community moderators
- If a conversation gets heated, step back

### DON'T: Neglect Channels After Posting
- Do not post your introduction and then disappear for two weeks
- If someone replies to you at 3am, respond the next morning -- don't leave it for days
- Consistency matters more than volume

## Handling "We Already Have AI Agents"

This will come up. Multiple chains already have AI agent projects (Autonolas, Fetch.ai, various chain-specific projects). Here's how to handle it.

### Response Framework

**Acknowledge, differentiate, find common ground.**

"Yeah, [project name] is doing great work on [specific thing they do]. We're coming at it from a different angle -- Meridian is specifically a developer framework/SDK rather than a hosted agent platform. Think of it like the difference between Heroku and Express.js. [Other project] gives you agents that work out of the box, we give developers the building blocks to create custom agents with their own strategy logic. There's room for both, and honestly, more autonomous DeFi agents in the ecosystem is good for everyone."

### Key Differentiators to Emphasize
- **Developer SDK vs. hosted platform:** Meridian is a framework developers use to build their own agents, not a pre-built agent service
- **Strategy DSL:** Users write strategies in a custom domain-specific language, not just pick from templates
- **Multi-chain from day one:** Not locked to one chain's architecture
- **On-chain identity:** ERC-721 agent registry means agents have provable, transferable identities
- **Open source (MIT):** Fully open, not a proprietary platform

### What NOT to Say
- Do not trash other projects. Ever.
- Do not claim you're "better" -- claim you're "different" or "complementary"
- Do not get into a feature comparison war
- Do not say "they're not real AI" or anything dismissive

## When to DM vs. Public Post

### Use Public Posts When:
- Introducing yourself (always public first)
- Asking technical questions (others benefit from the answers)
- Sharing project updates or milestones
- Engaging in ecosystem discussions
- Your first grant inquiry (shows transparency)

### Use DMs When:
- Following up on a public grant conversation that went positive
- A grant manager or team member explicitly says "DM me"
- Sharing sensitive details (testnet keys, contract addresses that aren't public yet)
- Scheduling a call or meeting
- Someone DMs you first

### DM Etiquette
- Always introduce yourself briefly even if you've interacted publicly. "Hey, we chatted in #dev earlier about [topic]. I'm Amit from Meridian."
- Keep DMs short. 3-5 sentences max for the first message.
- Do not DM multiple people on the same team about the same thing
- If someone doesn't respond to a DM within a week, do not send another one. Re-engage publicly instead.
- Never DM someone to ask them to look at your public post

## Timing and Cadence

### Best Times to Post (UTC)
- **US + Europe overlap:** 14:00-18:00 UTC (best for most Western-focused chains)
- **Asia-friendly:** 02:00-06:00 UTC (relevant for some Solana and BNB Chain communities)
- **Avoid:** Weekends tend to have lower engagement in most developer channels
- **Best days:** Tuesday through Thursday typically get the most dev engagement

### Posting Cadence Per Server
- **Week 1:** 3-4 messages (intro, technical question, engagement, grant inquiry)
- **Week 2-4:** 2-3 messages per week (mix of helpful responses and updates)
- **Ongoing:** 1-2 messages per week minimum to maintain presence

### Red Flags That You're Overdoing It
- You're the most recent poster in a channel more than twice in a row
- Nobody is responding to your messages
- Your messages are always the longest in the channel
- You're posting more than once per day in the same server

## Tracking Your Engagement

Keep a simple spreadsheet or note with:

| Chain | Server Joined | Intro Posted | Tech Q Posted | Grant Inquiry | Key Contacts | Status | Follow-up Date |
|-------|--------------|-------------|--------------|---------------|-------------|--------|---------------|
| Arbitrum | | | | | | | |
| NEAR | | | | | | | |
| ... | | | | | | | |

Track:
- Who responded to your messages (by name/handle)
- What they said and any promises made
- Any grant program deadlines mentioned
- Names of grant managers or ecosystem leads you interacted with

---

## Final Notes

The single most important thing: be a real community member, not a grant applicant passing through. Grant reviewers look at your history in the server. If your only messages are "here's my project, give me money," it shows. If you've been helpful, asked good questions, and engaged genuinely for a few weeks, your grant application carries real weight.

Play the long game. Even if a grant doesn't work out, the relationships and knowledge you build from genuine community engagement will be worth more in the long run.
