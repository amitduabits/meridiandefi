## Priority Ranking Rationale

| Priority | Chain | Reasoning |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | Arbitrum | Already deployed on Sepolia. Strongest existing traction. |
| 2 | NEAR | Chain Abstraction narrative fits perfectly. Access key model is ideal for agents. |
| 3 | Starknet | Native AA is the single best feature for autonomous agents. |
| 4 | Kadena | Formal verification in Pact is unique differentiator for agent safety. |
| 5 | Ethereum Foundation | Prestige + credibility. ESP grant signals legitimacy. |
| 6 | Taiko | Zero-modification deployment. Growing ecosystem. |
| 7 | Avalanche | Subnet model for dedicated agent infrastructure is compelling. |
| 8 | Solana | Huge DeFi ecosystem. Already have web3.js in the stack. |
| 9 | BNB Chain | Large TVL. PancakeSwap is easy Uniswap V3 adapter port. |
| 10 | Base | Growing fast. viem native. But single-sequencer is a concern for agents. |
| 11 | Polygon | Solid ecosystem but less differentiated for agents. |
| 12 | Sui | Object model is interesting but Move integration is heavier lift. |
| 13 | Optimism | Superchain angle is good but RetroPGF favors post-launch projects. |
