# Meridian Receives Grant from [CHAIN_NAME] Foundation

*Published [DATE] | meridianagents.xyz/blog*

We're proud to announce that Meridian has received a [$AMOUNT] grant from the [CHAIN_NAME] Foundation to advance autonomous agent infrastructure for DeFi.

This is a meaningful milestone for our team and for the broader vision of intelligent, self-operating DeFi systems.

## What We Built

Meridian is an open-source framework that lets developers build, test, and deploy autonomous agents for decentralized finance. An agent built with Meridian can monitor markets, evaluate opportunities, manage risk, and execute trades across multiple chains and protocols — all without manual intervention.

The framework is production-ready today: 19,000+ lines of code across TypeScript, Solidity, and Python. 208 tests passing. Over 100 autonomous trades executed. Eight core modules covering everything from LLM-powered reasoning to on-chain risk management.

We built protocol adapters for Uniswap V3, Aave V3, Jupiter, Curve, and Lido. We deployed auditable smart contracts for agent registration, payment escrow, and strategy vaults. We designed a monitoring dashboard that gives operators full visibility into what their agents are doing and why.

This isn't a whitepaper or a proof-of-concept. It's a working system.

## Why [CHAIN_NAME] Invested

The [CHAIN_NAME] Foundation recognized that as DeFi matures, the tooling for building on top of it needs to mature as well. Manual trading strategies don't scale. Copy-paste bots lack risk management. And most existing agent frameworks weren't designed with DeFi's unique challenges in mind — things like MEV protection, gas optimization, circuit breakers, and cross-protocol composability.

Meridian was built specifically for these problems. Every design decision, from our xstate-powered agent lifecycle to our pre-flight risk validation system, reflects the reality of operating in adversarial, high-stakes financial environments.

The [CHAIN_NAME] Foundation's grant allows us to deepen our integration with the [CHAIN_NAME] ecosystem: native protocol adapters, on-chain contract deployments, and optimized execution paths that take full advantage of [CHAIN_NAME]'s architecture.

## What's on the Roadmap

With this funding, we're focused on delivering:

**Near-term ([TIMELINE_SHORT]):**
- Production [CHAIN_NAME] protocol adapters for core DeFi primitives
- Agent Registry contract deployed to [CHAIN_NAME] mainnet
- Developer quickstart guide and example agents for [CHAIN_NAME]

**Mid-term ([TIMELINE_MID]):**
- Strategy Vault contracts on [CHAIN_NAME] for transparent performance tracking
- Multi-agent coordination patterns optimized for [CHAIN_NAME]
- Community-contributed strategy templates

**Longer-term ([TIMELINE_LONG]):**
- Cross-chain agent orchestration connecting [CHAIN_NAME] to other supported networks
- Advanced backtesting and simulation tools
- Developer SDK refinements based on community feedback

## Get Involved

Meridian is MIT-licensed and fully open-source. We believe the best infrastructure is built in the open, with input from the people who will use it.

Here's how you can participate:

- **Star and fork the repo:** [github.com/amitduabits/meridiandefi](https://github.com/amitduabits/meridiandefi)
- **Follow development:** [@MeridianAgents](https://twitter.com/MeridianAgents) on Twitter
- **Join the conversation:** [Discord link] for technical discussions and early access
- **Build with us:** Check out our examples directory for DCA bots, arbitrage scanners, yield optimizers, and more

Whether you're a DeFi developer looking for better agent tooling, a protocol team interested in integration, or a researcher exploring autonomous financial systems — we'd love to hear from you.

## Thank You

We're grateful to the [CHAIN_NAME] Foundation for their support and to everyone who has followed Meridian's development. This grant is fuel for the next phase of building, and we intend to make the most of it.

The future of DeFi is autonomous. We're building the infrastructure to make it happen.
