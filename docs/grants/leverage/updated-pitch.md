# Updated Pitch Template — Post First Grant

> Use this template for all subsequent grant applications after the first approval.
> The first grant fundamentally changes positioning: from "promising project" to "funded and validated."

## 1. New Opening Paragraph

Replace generic introductions with:

```
Meridian is a production-grade, open-source framework for autonomous DeFi agents —
currently funded by the [CHAIN_NAME] Foundation. We're building the infrastructure
that allows developers to deploy intelligent agents across every major chain and
protocol, starting with [CHAIN_NAME] and expanding to [TARGET_CHAIN].

We're applying to the [TARGET_CHAIN] grants program because [TARGET_CHAIN] is
a natural fit for Meridian's multi-chain architecture, and we're ready to bring
our proven agent framework to your ecosystem.
```

## 2. Updated Traction Section

```
### Traction

- **Funded by [CHAIN_NAME] Foundation** — [$AMOUNT] grant awarded [DATE]
- **19,000+ lines** of production TypeScript, Solidity, and Python
- **208 tests passing** across 12 test suites (unit, integration, contract)
- **100+ autonomous trades** executed across testnet and mainnet
- **8 core modules** — runtime engine, LLM integration, chain connectors,
  strategy engine, memory system, agent communication, risk management,
  monitoring dashboard
- **5 protocol adapters** — Uniswap V3, Aave V3, Jupiter, Curve, Lido
- **3 smart contracts** — Agent Registry, Payment Escrow, Strategy Vault
- **MIT licensed** — fully open-source at github.com/amitduabits/meridiandefi
```

## 3. The Momentum Narrative

Use this framing in the "Why Now" or "Background" section:

```
### Why Now

The [CHAIN_NAME] Foundation's investment in Meridian validated a thesis we've
held since day one: DeFi needs better infrastructure for autonomous agents,
and that infrastructure should be open, composable, and chain-agnostic.

With [CHAIN_NAME] as our anchor chain, we're now in a position to expand
Meridian's chain connector module to support [TARGET_CHAIN]. This isn't
starting from scratch — it's extending a funded, tested, and production-ready
framework to a new ecosystem.

Each additional chain we support creates a network effect: agents on [CHAIN_NAME]
can coordinate with agents on [TARGET_CHAIN], enabling cross-chain strategies
that neither ecosystem could support alone.
```

---

## 4. Multi-Chain Positioning (Avoiding "Scattered" Perception)

When applying to multiple chains simultaneously, frame it as architecture, not opportunism:

```
Meridian's architecture is explicitly multi-chain by design. Our Chain Connector
Module provides a unified interface (IDeFiConnector) that abstracts protocol
differences — meaning an agent written for Uniswap on Ethereum can execute on
Trader Joe on Avalanche with the same strategy logic.

We pursue grants from multiple ecosystems because each chain adds genuine value
to the framework:

- [CHAIN_NAME]: [specific value — e.g., "low-cost execution for high-frequency strategies"]
- [TARGET_CHAIN]: [specific value — e.g., "deep DeFi liquidity for yield optimization"]
- [FUTURE_CHAIN]: [specific value — e.g., "parallel execution for multi-agent coordination"]

This is not about spreading thin — it's about building the connective tissue
that makes cross-chain DeFi agents possible.
```

Subject: Meridian Update — Now Funded by [CHAIN_NAME] Foundation

Hi [CONTACT_NAME],

Quick update on our application to the [TARGET_CHAIN] grants program —

We're pleased to share that Meridian has been awarded a [$AMOUNT] grant from
the [CHAIN_NAME] Foundation, recognizing our work on autonomous DeFi agent
infrastructure.

This doesn't change our commitment to [TARGET_CHAIN] — if anything, it
accelerates it. The [CHAIN_NAME] grant funds core framework development
that directly benefits every chain we support, including [TARGET_CHAIN].

We'd love to discuss how Meridian can bring the same value to [TARGET_CHAIN]'s
ecosystem. Happy to jump on a call or share updated materials.

Our updated traction:
- [CHAIN_NAME] Foundation grant: [$AMOUNT] ([DATE])
- 19,000+ LOC | 208 tests | 100+ autonomous trades
- [TARGET_CHAIN] adapter work already in our roadmap

Thanks for your time, and looking forward to hearing from you.

Best,
[NAME]
Meridian (@MeridianAgents)

## 6. Pitch Deck Slide Updates

Update these slides in the pitch deck:

| Slide | Change |
|-------|--------|
| Title slide | Add "[CHAIN_NAME] Foundation Grantee" subtitle |
| Traction slide | Add foundation logo + grant amount |
| Roadmap slide | Show [CHAIN_NAME] milestones as "funded" |
| Team slide | Add "backed by" logos below team photos |
| Ask slide | Frame as "expanding proven model to [TARGET_CHAIN]" |

## 7. Credibility Signals to Weave In

Use these naturally throughout applications — don't force them:

- "As a [CHAIN_NAME] Foundation grantee, we understand the expectations of ecosystem-funded development..."
- "Our work on [CHAIN_NAME], supported by their grants program, has shown that..."
- "The [CHAIN_NAME] Foundation's due diligence process validated our technical approach..."
- "We've demonstrated accountability to [CHAIN_NAME] and bring the same discipline to [TARGET_CHAIN]..."

---

## 8. What NOT to Do

- Do not lead with "we got money from someone else, give us money too"
- Do not disclose exact grant amounts if the foundation asked for confidentiality
- Do not frame other chains as secondary to [CHAIN_NAME]
- Do not copy-paste identical applications — each chain needs specific hooks
- Do not mention pending applications to other chains in a given application
- Do not overstate the grant — if it's a small grant, don't position it as a Series A equivalent
