## Tweet 1 — The Announcement

```
We're thrilled to announce that Meridian has received a [$AMOUNT] grant from @[CHAIN_FOUNDATION_HANDLE].

Meridian is building the autonomous intelligence layer for DeFi — and [CHAIN_NAME] is where we're bringing it to life first.

Huge thanks to the [CHAIN_NAME] grants team for believing in what we're building.

[1/5]

## Tweet 2 — What We're Building

```
What we'll build with this funding:

- Production-grade [CHAIN_NAME] protocol adapters (swap, lend, stake, bridge)
- On-chain agent registry deployed to [CHAIN_NAME]
- Strategy vault contracts for transparent agent performance tracking
- Multi-agent coordination running natively on [CHAIN_NAME]

All open-source. All composable.

[2/5]
```

## Tweet 3 — The Journey

```
Some context on our grant journey:

We applied with 19,000+ lines of production code, 208 passing tests, and 100+ autonomous trades already executed.

Meridian isn't a whitepaper — it's a working framework. The [CHAIN_NAME] team recognized that, and we're grateful.

This grant validates the approach: build first, then seek support.

## Tweet 4 — What This Means for [CHAIN_NAME]

```
What this means for the @[CHAIN_ECOSYSTEM_HANDLE] ecosystem:

Developers will be able to deploy autonomous DeFi agents on [CHAIN_NAME] using a single framework — with built-in risk management, strategy backtesting, and multi-chain support.

Think of it as the Rails for DeFi agents, starting on [CHAIN_NAME].

[4/5]
