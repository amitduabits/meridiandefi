**To:** [PROGRAM_CONTACT_EMAIL]

Hi [CONTACT_NAME],

I wanted to reach out with a more substantial update on Meridian since our grant application to [PROGRAM_NAME] on [SUBMISSION_DATE]. We've hit several significant milestones that I believe strengthen our alignment with your program's goals.

**Major Milestones Since Application:**

1. **[MILESTONE_1]:** [Description — e.g., "Completed full integration with [CHAIN]'s DeFi stack including [PROTOCOL_1], [PROTOCOL_2], and [PROTOCOL_3]"]
2. **[MILESTONE_2]:** [Description — e.g., "Deployed and validated autonomous agent execution with 100+ trades on testnet, zero failures"]
3. **[MILESTONE_3]:** [Description — e.g., "Published open-source SDK with comprehensive documentation and developer examples"]

**Updated Metrics:**

| Metric | At Submission | Current |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| Codebase | [X] LOC | 19,000+ LOC |
| Test Coverage | [X] tests | 208 tests passing |
| Autonomous Trades | [X] | 100+ on Arbitrum Sepolia |
| Chain Integrations | [X] | [CURRENT_COUNT] |
| GitHub Stars | [X] | [CURRENT_STARS] |

**Ecosystem Momentum:**

[If applicable — mention any grants approved by other chains. Be specific but not boastful.]

We're pleased to share that [OTHER_CHAIN]'s grant program has [approved our application / expressed strong interest / invited us to their accelerator]. This validation reinforces the demand for autonomous agent infrastructure across DeFi. That said, [CHAIN_NAME] remains a strategic priority for Meridian — your ecosystem's [SPECIFIC_STRENGTH — e.g., "liquidity depth," "developer tooling," "L2 scalability"] makes it the ideal environment for our agents.

**New Chain Integrations:**

Since applying, we've extended Meridian's connector layer to support [NEW_CHAIN_1] and [NEW_CHAIN_2], bringing our total supported chain count to [X]. Each integration includes full adapter coverage for major protocols.

**What We're Building Next:**

- [NEXT_MILESTONE_1 — e.g., "Mainnet deployment with gradual rollout strategy"]
- [NEXT_MILESTONE_2 — e.g., "Agent-to-agent communication protocol via libp2p"]
- [NEXT_MILESTONE_3 — e.g., "Advanced risk management with circuit breakers and anomaly detection"]

We remain enthusiastic about building on [CHAIN_NAME] and contributing to your ecosystem's growth. A grant from [PROGRAM_NAME] would accelerate our [SPECIFIC_DELIVERABLE] timeline significantly.

I'd welcome the chance to walk your team through a live demo or answer any technical questions. Would a 15-minute call work sometime this week or next?
