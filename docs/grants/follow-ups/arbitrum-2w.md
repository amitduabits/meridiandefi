**Subject:** Meridian — Grant Follow-Up + Live Testnet Activity on Arbitrum Sepolia

---

Hi [CONTACT_NAME / Arbitrum Grants Team],

I'm following up on Meridian's grant application submitted on [SUBMISSION_DATE]. As you'll recall, Meridian is an open-source autonomous agent framework built specifically for DeFi — and Arbitrum is where we've been building and testing from day one.

Here's what we've shipped since applying:

- **100+ Autonomous Trades on Arbitrum Sepolia:** Our agents have executed over 100 trades on Arbitrum's testnet with zero failed transactions. This includes DCA strategies, rebalancing, and cross-protocol arbitrage — all fully autonomous with risk pre-flight checks on every transaction.
- **Arbitrum-Optimized Execution:** We leverage Arbitrum's low gas costs to enable strategies that would be economically unfeasible on L1. Our agents batch operations and optimize calldata specifically for Nitro's compression.
- **Full Protocol Adapter Suite:** Production-ready integrations with Uniswap V3 (Arbitrum deployment), Aave V3, Curve, and GMX — covering the core of Arbitrum's DeFi ecosystem.
- **Codebase Growth:** 19,000+ LOC with 208 tests passing. Full TypeScript SDK, Solidity contracts, monitoring dashboard, and server infrastructure.

Arbitrum is our primary deployment target because of the ecosystem's DeFi depth, transaction economics, and developer-friendly infrastructure. We're not just building *on* Arbitrum — we're building *for* Arbitrum.

Would your team be available for a **15-minute demo**? I can show our agents executing live on Arbitrum Sepolia, including the risk management system and real-time monitoring dashboard.

We've also received interest from other L2 and alt-L1 ecosystem programs, but Arbitrum's DeFi TVL and protocol diversity make it the clear first-choice for Meridian's mainnet launch.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

## Arbitrum-Specific Notes

- Lead with **testnet activity on Arbitrum Sepolia** — this is your strongest proof point
- Arbitrum values DeFi-native projects and TVL drivers
- Mention GMX, Camelot, Radiant, or other Arbitrum-native protocols if integrated
- Reference Stylus (Rust/Wasm smart contracts) if exploring it — shows forward-thinking
- Arbitrum DAO grants go through Snapshot voting — community sentiment matters
- Consider posting a build update on the Arbitrum forum for visibility
- Telegram and Discord are primary community channels
