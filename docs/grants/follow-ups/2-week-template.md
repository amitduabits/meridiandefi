Hi [CONTACT_NAME],

I hope this message finds you well. I'm writing to follow up on Meridian's grant application submitted on [SUBMISSION_DATE] to the [PROGRAM_NAME].

Since submitting, our team has continued shipping at pace, and I wanted to share a few highlights:

- **[NEW_FEATURE_1]:** [Brief description — e.g., "Launched cross-chain arbitrage detection across Uniswap V3 and Curve, reducing latency to under 200ms"]
- **[NEW_FEATURE_2]:** [Brief description — e.g., "Expanded our test suite to 208 passing tests across 12 test files with full CI coverage"]
- **[METRIC_UPDATE]:** [Brief description — e.g., "Surpassed 100 autonomous trades executed on Arbitrum Sepolia with zero failed transactions"]
- **[COMMUNITY_UPDATE]:** [Brief description — e.g., "Grew our developer community to [X] members with [Y] GitHub stars"]

Our codebase now stands at 19,000+ lines of production TypeScript across the monorepo, with the full SDK, smart contracts, monitoring dashboard, and server infrastructure complete.

I'd love the opportunity to give your team a **15-minute live demo** of Meridian in action — autonomous agents executing DeFi strategies in real time. I'm happy to work around your schedule.

I should also mention that we've received interest from [OTHER_CHAIN_NAME]'s ecosystem team, but [CHAIN_NAME] remains our top priority for initial deployment given the depth of your DeFi ecosystem.

Looking forward to hearing from you. Happy to provide any additional information that would be helpful for your review.
