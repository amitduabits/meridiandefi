**Subject:** Meridian on Arbitrum — Milestone Update + Mainnet Readiness

---

Hi [CONTACT_NAME / Arbitrum Grants Team],

I'm writing with a comprehensive update on Meridian since our grant application on [SUBMISSION_DATE]. Over the past month, we've deepened our commitment to Arbitrum and are approaching mainnet readiness.

**Major Milestones:**

1. **100+ Successful Autonomous Trades on Arbitrum Sepolia:** Our agents have maintained a perfect execution record across DCA, rebalancing, and multi-protocol arbitrage strategies. Every transaction passes a 7-point risk pre-flight check (position size, exposure, gas, slippage, contract approval, daily loss limit, simulation).

2. **Deep Arbitrum DeFi Integration:** Full adapter coverage for Arbitrum's core protocols:
   - **Uniswap V3** — Swaps, concentrated liquidity positions, fee collection
   - **Aave V3** — Supply, borrow, repay, flash loans
   - **Curve** — Stable swaps, gauge deposits, CRV rewards
   - **GMX** — [If integrated: perpetuals, GLP/GM operations]
   Agents can compose strategies across these protocols in a single decision cycle.

3. **Nitro-Optimized Execution:** Calldata optimization for Arbitrum's compression, gas estimation tuned for L2 pricing, and transaction batching that takes advantage of Arbitrum's throughput.

4. **Monitoring Dashboard Live:** Real-time portfolio tracking, agent health monitoring, equity curves, and risk metrics — all built with React 18, TanStack Query, and tRPC for type-safe data flow.

**Updated Metrics:**

| Metric | At Submission | Current |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| Trades on Arbitrum Sepolia | [X] | 100+ (zero failures) |
| Protocol Integrations | [X] | 4+ Arbitrum-native |
| Codebase | [X] LOC | 19,000+ LOC |
| Tests Passing | [X] | 208 |
| Agent Strategies | [X] | DCA, Rebalancer, Arb Scanner, Yield Optimizer, Liquidation Protector |

**Ecosystem Validation:**

[If applicable:] We're pleased to share that [Ethereum ESP / other program] has [approved / shown strong interest in] our application. This validates the demand for autonomous agent infrastructure, and we see Arbitrum as the ideal deployment environment given its DeFi liquidity concentration and cost efficiency.

**Arbitrum Mainnet Roadmap:**

With grant support, our Arbitrum-specific deliverables would be:
- **Month 1:** Mainnet deployment with conservative risk parameters, limited to whitelisted strategies
- **Month 2:** Open SDK access for Arbitrum developers, documentation, and example agents targeting Arbitrum protocols
- **Month 3:** Agent-to-agent communication network, Arbitrum-native strategy marketplace, community onboarding

**Why Arbitrum First:**

Arbitrum commands the largest L2 DeFi TVL, the deepest protocol diversity, and the most active developer community. For autonomous agents that need liquid markets, fast finality, and low execution costs, there is no better home. Every Meridian agent deployed on Arbitrum drives protocol interactions, volume, and ecosystem engagement.

We'd love to schedule a **15-minute technical demo** with your team. Seeing agents execute live on Arbitrum Sepolia — with real-time risk checks and the monitoring dashboard — communicates what Meridian delivers far better than any application document.

## Arbitrum-Specific Notes

- At 4 weeks, consider also engaging with Arbitrum DAO delegates directly
- Post build updates on the Arbitrum governance forum for community visibility
- If Arbitrum DAO vote is required, building delegate relationships is critical
- Mention any Arbitrum-specific events attended (Arbitrum Day, etc.)
- Highlight TVL impact potential — Arbitrum grants often care about ecosystem TVL growth
- If exploring Stylus for agent components, mention it as a future direction
- Consider applying to Arbitrum-native accelerators (Castle, etc.) as a parallel path
