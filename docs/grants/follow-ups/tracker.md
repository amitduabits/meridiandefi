## Leverage Matrix

When one chain approves, use it as social proof for others. Update this table as grants are approved.

| Approved Grant | Mention In Follow-Up To |
|----------------|------------------------|
| Ethereum ESP | Arbitrum, Avalanche (validates EVM work) |
| Arbitrum | Ethereum ESP, Avalanche (validates L2 demand) |
| Kadena | NEAR (validates alt-L1 interest) |
| NEAR | Kadena, Avalanche (validates non-EVM expansion) |
| Avalanche | Arbitrum, Ethereum ESP (validates EVM + subnet thesis) |
