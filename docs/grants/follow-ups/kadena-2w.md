Hi [CONTACT_NAME / Kadena Grants Team],

I'm following up on Meridian's grant application submitted on [SUBMISSION_DATE] to the Kadena Grants Program. Meridian is an open-source autonomous agent framework for DeFi, and we see Kadena's unique architecture as a compelling opportunity for next-generation agent infrastructure.

Since submitting, we've continued building with Kadena integration on our roadmap:

- **Pact Smart Contract Research:** We've been studying Kadena's Pact language and its formal verification capabilities. Pact's human-readable design and built-in safety features align with Meridian's risk-first philosophy — agents that interact with formally verifiable contracts create a fundamentally safer DeFi experience.
- **Chainweb Multi-Chain Architecture:** We've begun designing our connector to leverage Kadena's braided multi-chain architecture for parallel agent execution. The ability to run agents across multiple chains simultaneously, with shared security, is a differentiator no other L1 offers.
- **Production Track Record:** Our framework has executed 100+ autonomous trades on EVM testnets with zero failures, across a 19,000+ LOC codebase with 208 passing tests. This production-grade foundation is what we're bringing to Kadena.
- **SDK Architecture Ready for Pact:** Our connector interface (`IDeFiConnector`) is chain-agnostic by design. Adding a Kadena connector means Pact-based DeFi protocols (Kaddex, Kadenaswap) get autonomous agent support immediately.

We're excited about bringing intelligent automation to Kadena's ecosystem. The combination of Pact's safety guarantees and Meridian's risk management creates a uniquely secure environment for autonomous DeFi operations.

Would your team have **15 minutes for a demo call**? I'd love to show our agent framework in action and discuss the technical details of our Kadena integration roadmap.

We've received interest from several EVM-based ecosystem programs, but Kadena's differentiated architecture and growing DeFi ecosystem present an opportunity we're especially eager to pursue.
