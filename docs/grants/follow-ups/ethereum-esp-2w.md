**Subject:** Meridian — ESP Application Follow-Up + Ethereum-Specific Progress

Hi ESP Team,

I'm following up on Meridian's grant application submitted on [SUBMISSION_DATE] to the Ecosystem Support Program. We're building an open-source autonomous agent framework for DeFi, and Ethereum remains the foundation of everything we're building.

Since submitting, we've made meaningful progress specifically relevant to Ethereum's ecosystem:

- **EVM Connector Hardened:** Our viem-based chain connector now supports full adapter coverage for Uniswap V3, Aave V3, Curve, and Lido — all battle-tested Ethereum-native protocols. Every interaction is type-safe with strict TypeScript and simulation-first execution.
- **MEV Protection Integrated:** We've implemented Flashbots Protect integration for transaction submission, ensuring Meridian agents don't contribute to harmful MEV extraction — aligned with Ethereum's commitment to a fair transaction supply chain.
- **Smart Contracts Auditable:** Our Solidity contracts (AgentRegistry, PaymentEscrow, StrategyVault, Governance) follow CEI patterns, use OpenZeppelin v5, and include comprehensive Foundry test suites with gas reporting.
- **Public Good Orientation:** Meridian is fully MIT-licensed with 19,000+ LOC open source. Our SDK is designed so any developer can deploy autonomous DeFi agents without proprietary lock-in.

We believe Meridian contributes to Ethereum's public goods layer by making sophisticated DeFi automation accessible to independent developers and small teams — not just institutions with proprietary infrastructure.

Would your team be open to a **15-minute demo call**? I'd love to show our agents executing strategies on Ethereum testnets in real time, including the Flashbots integration and risk pre-flight system.

I should note that we've received interest from several L2 ecosystem programs, but we see Ethereum L1 infrastructure as our primary commitment — L2 deployments are extensions of, not replacements for, our Ethereum-first approach.

Thank you for your consideration. Happy to provide any additional technical details.

## Ethereum-Specific Notes

- ESP cares deeply about **public goods** and **ecosystem benefit** — lead with open-source and developer tooling angles
- Mention Flashbots and MEV protection — shows Ethereum values alignment
- Reference EIP standards compliance where applicable
- ESP process can be slow (6-12 weeks) — be patient but persistent
- Consider mentioning any Ethereum community involvement (ETH Denver, Devcon, etc.)
